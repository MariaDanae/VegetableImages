# Implementation of Augmentor and DenseNet on Vegetable Images

## Overview
This is an Image Classification solution using Colab notebooks for classifying vegetable images found on Kaggle using Augmentor and DenseNe.

## How to use

1) Copy the VegetableImages.ipynb file and open as a Colab notebook in your Google Drive.
2) Create a Kaggle account to obtain your own username and password which are saved in a file called "kaggle.json" and should be saved in your Google Drive along with the VegetableImages.ipynb downloaded in the previous step
3) Open the VegetableImages.ipyn file and change the directory locations according to your own folder structure.

## Running the solution
The following steps were taken to achieve this solution:
1) obtain kaggle zipped file of vegetable images and unzip them
2) Alter images using Augmentor
3) Create datasets based on these augmented images
4) Use DenseNet model
5) Resulting accuracy and confusion matrix
